Hi! I am Tadashi Kozuno. I am currently a researcher at [OMRON SINIC X Corp.](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/). Previuosly, I spent a wonderful year as a postdoc working with [Prof. Martha White](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) and [Prof. Csaba Szepesvári](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/) at the [［University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html). I was also at [OIST](https://www.oist.jp/), where I obtained PhD. My main interest lies in efficient decision making from both theoretical and biological sides. (Indeed, I was doing neuroscience before!) For a list of publications, please see [my Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4VJmx8QAAAAJ).
