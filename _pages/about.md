Hi! I am Tadashi Kozuno. I am currently a postdoc at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) working with [Prof. Martha White](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) and [Prof. Csaba Szepesv√°ri](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/). Before this position, I was at [OIST](https://www.oist.jp/), where I obtained PhD. My main interest lies in efficient decision making from both theoretical and biological sides. (Indeed, I was doing neuroscience before!) For a list of publications, please see [my Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4VJmx8QAAAAJ).
